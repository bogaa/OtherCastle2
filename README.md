# OtherCastle2
A Super Castlevania IV hack

You can test the patches provided in the release folder. You need to patch the Super Castlevania (USA) ROM
for feedback you can also use Discord https://discord.gg/PvFgxRg

You like to use this to make your own levels? Here is what you need to do:
- get SC4 US ROM
- Downnload and Save OtherCastle2 file where you like to have them. 
- Get SC4Ed (Needed 2 edit levels)
- Make folder called ROM in root directory and put the ROM in there.
- In the release folder you find (sc4Version2EditInSC4Ed.bps) patch the ROM you put in the folder.

You can click the main.bat file to patch my changes with Asar and a new ROM will be copied into the Root directory. 
Some changes you find in the preMain.asm are applyed to the ROM in the ROM directory. It contains changes that will not confuse the editor.
It makes it also possible to experiment with the code. Just repatch to apply changes again and get rid of screwups.
